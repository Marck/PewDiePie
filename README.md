# PewDiePie Discord bot

## Why did I make this bot?

I made this bot because I was very intrigued into the PewDiePie vs T-Series war. I wanted to do my part and make a bot.

## How do I get authorized for the subgap command?

Post your server invite in the [support server](https://discord.gg/we4DQ5u) containing...

1. Why we should authorize your server.
2. Agreeing to **create a new channel for the subgap command**.
3. Making the channel easy to view by members in your server.
4. Changing permissions to not allow regular members to message in the subgap channel.

## How should I run the bot?

I strongly recommend that you [invite the bot](https://discordbots.org/bot/500868806776979462/) and no effort will be extended to running an instance of my bot with the code provided in this repository.

## What are the commands?
